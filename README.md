# Non-verbal Korean Dialogue Modeling Using Deep Learning 

### Summary
Korean conversation modeling using deep learning. 
We build Seq2Seq Model and HRED Model, and test them.  
We completed the chatbot by linking the results with Kakao Talk Chatbot API.  

### Paper Study
1. (Word Embedding 1) Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality 
2. (Word Embedding 2) GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation
3. (GRU) Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation
4. (seq2seq) Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks
5. (attention) Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate
6. (conversation) Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models
